   — ```items``` - the list of branches
   — ```total``` - the total number of results found
   — ```markers``` - the list of coordinates for all results found
   — ```top_rubrics``` - the set of top rubrics(ids) for the current results (rubrics that are present in 30% of all results)
   
   Each ```items``` entry has the following structure:
